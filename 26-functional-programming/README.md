## Functional Programming and applications of Functions as First Class Citizens

### Review Functions
 - What ways can we write them?

### Passing a Function to another Function (Callbacks)
 - Let's make our own version of .map()
 - allows for flexible and custom behavior

### Return a Function from another Function
 - Function Factories

### Nested Functions
 - Closures

### Scope (var, let, const)

### Run once and only once
- IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)

## Functional Programming (vs. Object Oriented Programming)
 - Pure Functions
 - Does not mutate state, affecting global variables or other parts of the program
 - Declarative code
 - Each function does one thing




## Announcement:
- Functional Programming Lab
- This afternoon, we are deploying labs on the DOM
  - Note: Konami Lab test cases don't work...
  - DOM Challenge is a results driven lab
