### Goals for Module 3
- Learn how to learn a new programming languages
- Learn how to problem solve, break things down, and work incrementally (debugging)
- Learn how to be resourceful

### JavaScript History
- Created by Brendan Eich in 1995
- Wanted to turn the web into something like a desktop application (SPA)
- Not related to JAVA (JS was first code named Mocha, then LiveScript)
- So vast...

### Intro to Javascript
- HTML, CSS, and JS (behavior)
- Set up index.html, script.js, chrome console
- script tag at the bottom of the .html file?

### Learning a New Programming language
- How to Debug (console.log(), alert(), debugger)
- Documentation [MDN]((https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/))

### Difference between Ruby and JS
- explicit return (JS is more syntactically strict)
- JS is more syntactically flexible
- JS is more functional (behavioral)
- cammelCase is the convention
- type coercion

- everything is either a primitive DT or an object

### Datatypes
- What types and how many?
- strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined
- objects { }
 - Functions
 - Arrays
 - Objects


### Announcements
- FSPs
  - like blogs but slides styled
  - in groups of two or three
  - ~6 min presentation
  - Tip: the narrower the scope, the better
  - Announce groups on Thursday

- Advance Functions and Scope is the lecture topic this afternoon
